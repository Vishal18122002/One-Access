# ONE-ACCESS

One Access is a Single Identity System which eliminates the old Password Authentication method with Biometrical Recognition on a Decentralized network.
User can create their own Identity (USERNAME, Biometrics) which they can use on any platform as Decentralized Single Sign-on.
And also only by using biometrics the user can login into any devices without storing their biometric data locally on those devices.
User's have direct control over their personal device and can also control their data in One Access.
